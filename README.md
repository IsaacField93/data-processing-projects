This dataset presents a sample record of grocery store transactions.

I tasked myself with determining what pairs of items are most frequently purchased together. I visualize how often pairs of items are purchased together and determmine which pairs frequencies are statistically significant.

Finally, I present my findings and recommendations: Take advantage of the statistically significant pairs by offering discounts/promotions and further investigate these pairs to determine if they are demand elastic or inelastic. A further analysis into item prices- not included in this dataset- could help with determining strategic promotion strategies.
